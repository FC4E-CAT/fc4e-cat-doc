  title: PID Compliance Assessment Toolkit (CAT) - API
  description: "PID Compliance Assessment Toolkit (CAT) - API : The Compliance Assessment\
    \ Toolkit will support the EOSC PID policy with services to encode, record, and\
    \ query compliance with the policy. To do so, a wide range of compliance requirements\
    \ ( TRUST, FAIR, PID Policy, Reproducibility, GDPR, Licences) will be evaluated\
    \ as use cases for definition of a conceptual model. At the same time, vocabularies,\
    \ concepts, and designs are intended to be re-usable for other compliance needs:\
    \ TRUST, FAIR, POSI, CARE, Data Commons, etc. This will be followed by a supporting\
    \ service specification (the framework), accompanied  by development and testing\
    \ of operational services for PID Policy Compliance monitoring. Though primarily\
    \ aimed at machine-actionable operations, the API-based services will be complemented\
    \ by user interfaces to broaden its use."
