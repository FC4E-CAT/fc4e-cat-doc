## Import manual assessment
One of the basic functionalities of CAT is that the Validated User may import a manual assessment . The Assessement should be a file of json format following the schema 
that is used by CAT. 

### Step 1: Import a manual assessment. 

As a first step, the user should just  import the file .  Then a check and a validation is done by CAT.

The main rules that are checked are the following:
 - If it follows the correct schema
 - If it can be assigned to a specific type of actor
