### Viewing Validations

Upon entering the **Validations** tab, users can view a comprehensive list of validations associated with their account. The following information is displayed for each validation request:

- **Validation ID**: A unique identifier for the validation.
- **Organisation Name**: The name of the organisation for which the validation is being processed.
- **Actor Name**: The name of the individual associated with the validation.
- **User Role**: The role of the user within the organisation.
- **Validation Status**: The current status of the validation request. Possible statuses include:
  - **Approved**
  - **Pending Review**
  - **Rejected**

To view more details about a specific validation request, users can click the **Details** button ![](/img/details_validation_button.png) next to the validation. This will redirect them to a detailed page where further information about the validation is provided.

### Creating a New Validation

To create a new validation request, users should click the **Create New** button, which will redirect them to the validation creation page.

On the validation creation page, users will need to provide the following information:

1. **Actor Role**: Specify the role of the actor for the validation.
2. **Organisation Name**: Choose the organisation on behalf of which the validation is being made.
3. **User Role**: Specify the user's role within the chosen organisation.

Once the necessary fields are filled in, users can click the **Submit** button to create the validation request. If they wish to cancel the process, they can click the **Cancel** button.

Upon submission, the validation request will be placed in a **Pending Review** status. A notification email will be sent to the administrators to inform them of the new validation request. Additionally, an email will be sent to the user confirming that their validation request has been successfully received and is currently under review.
