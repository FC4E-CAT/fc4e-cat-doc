## Manage Users

As an admin, you have the ability to manage users within the system. This includes viewing user details, deleting users, and searching for users based on specific filters.

### Navigate to Users

To manage users, an admin should navigate to the **Users** tab from the **Personal Menu** located on the left sidebar under the **Manage** section.

</p>

On this page, the admin will see a list of all registered users.

### Search for Users

To search for users, the admin can use the **search bar** and filter options provided on the page. The search allows you to find users by the following criteria:

1. **Type:**
    - Search for users by type, such as **Verified**, **Identified**, or **Admin**.
    - Select the user type from the dropdown menu to filter the results.

    - Select the desired status from the dropdown menu.

    - Enter keywords into the search bar to filter users by name, email, or other relevant information.

The search results will update dynamically based on the selected filters.

### View a User

An admin can view a user by clicking on the View user details button.

<p align="center">

A modal will open displaying detailed information about the user

### Delete a User

An admin can delete one of the tests by clicking on the Delete test button.
<p align="center">
   ![](/img/manage/admin_users/admin_users_delete_button.png)
</p>

In this modal, the admin is required to provide a **Reason** for deleting the user.
- **Reason (*):** This field is required. Admins must enter a brief reason for the deletion (e.g., violation of terms, user request, etc.). 

<p align="center">
  ![](/img/manage/admin_users/admin_users_delete.png)
</p>

After entering the reason, the admin can click the **Delete** button to delete the user. If they change their mind, they can click **Cancel**.

:::warning
Be cautious when deleting users, as this action is irreversible.

Once the user is deleted, the admin will be redirected back to the list of users.
