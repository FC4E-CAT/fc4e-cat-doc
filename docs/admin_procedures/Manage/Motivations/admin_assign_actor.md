Once a motivation is created, administrators can enrich it by decoding the guidelines, by assigning **Principle** , **Criteria**, **Tests**, and **Actors**. These components help define the structure and evaluation logic of the motivation, ensuring that the assessment is both meaningful and actionable.

To begin editing or expanding a motivation, click the ![](/img/manage/admin_motivations/motivation_view_button.png) button to access the **Motivation Details** page.

</p>

On the **Motivation Details** page, you can:

- **Assign Actors**: Select the actor, that the motivation applies to.
- **Add Principles and Criteria**: Structure the motivation by defining high-level principles and measurable criteria that reflect the motivation's intent.
- **Define Tests**: Configure the validation logic under each criterion to ensure compliance or performance can be objectively assessed.

## Add Actor

The first step in constructing a **Motivation** is to associate it with an **Actor**. This association defines the context and scope of the assessment and ensures that all subsequent principles, criteria, and tests are evaluated with respect to the selected actor.

To begin:

Click the **Add Actor** button: ![](/img/manage/admin_motivations/motivation_add_actor_button.png)

A modal window will appear, prompting you to configure the actor assignment:

- **Select an Actor**:  
  Choose an actor from the dropdown list. This list may include individuals, organizations, or system components, depending on your setup.

- **Click Create**:  
  Once an actor is selected, click the **Create** button to confirm the assignment. This action links the actor to the current motivation and sets the foundation for building a structured evaluation.


Upon successful assignment, you will be automatically redirected to the **Motivation Builder** page. This is where the real construction begins â€” you can now define:

- **Principles**: High-level grouping of the criteria, based on the guidelines.
- **Criteria**: Specific, measurable conditions derived from the guidelines.
- **Tests**: Detailed validation mechanisms that verify compliance with the criteria.
