## Publish Motivations in CAT 

A motivation is initially considered to be in an **UNPUBLISHED** status, during creation. This means that the administrator can add, update, or delete context in the motivation.
The status can change if the administrator decides to **PUBLISHED** the motivation. By publishing the motivation, the administrator 
declares that no further changes will be applied to the motivation's context. 

FC4E CAT Service provides the **PUBLISH** feature at two levels:
1. **Motivation** level - The administrator can choose to publish a motivation.
2. **Motivation-actor relation** level. The administrator can choose to publish the relation between a motivation and an actor related to the motivation.

- When publishing a motivation, all associated motivation-actor relations are also published, automatically.

At both levels, if status is **PUBLISHED add/update/delete** actions on the motivation's context are not permitted. Also, the following elements: metrics, criteria, principles, tests, test methods, and test definitions, also are not permitted to be updated or deleted, if they are part of a published motivation or motivation-actor relation.

Additionally, when a motivation is an **UNPUBLISHED** status, only administrator can view of the motivation's template. Unpublished motivation's template view is not permitted to the users.
