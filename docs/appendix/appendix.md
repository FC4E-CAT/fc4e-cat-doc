Basic concepts through CAT service are presented below:

| Concept          	| Description   	                   | 
|------------------	|---------------------------------------- |
| Motivations          | these represent the rationale for development of a set of principles, policy provisions, or objectives. The motivations can be thought of as a hierarchy, and it may well be that some motivations represent more than one higher-level node |
| Standards         	|  Several of the case studies could be identified as largely contributing to standardisation of implementation. |
| Metrics         	|  One of the case studies (FAIR Data Maturity) is the best representative of a collection of metrics (or indicators), each metric identifies benchmarks or standards whereby the measured value will be contextualised. Metrics point to tests that determine, as reproducibly as possible, a value to compare to the benchmark or standard. Note that tests can also be standardised - but these standards are distinct from ‘performance’ standards discussed above.|
|Tools | Several of the case studies represent tools that can be used to determine level of compliance or performance against a benchmark|
|Guidelines |Guidelines, recommendations, and best practices are provided by several of the case studies.|
