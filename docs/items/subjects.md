## Subjects in CAT 

<p> A subject in CAT may be an object, entity or service, a web resource identified by the owner offered by an Authority, Provider, or Manager, for which the assessment will  be completed. </p>
 <p> It is a main concept in the assessment procedure, and relates the actors registered in the ecosystem, with a service, entity or object to be assessed.</p>
 <p> The validated user can easily manage its own subjects. He can create, update, delete, search the subjects he owns.</p>
<p> A subject (service or object) can be assessed for PID Policy Compliance, but it can also be assessed for other motivations (assessment types). </p>
