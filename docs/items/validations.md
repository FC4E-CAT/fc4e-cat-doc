## Validation Requests in CAT 
<br/>
<p>A Validation Request is a prerequisite for Identified users to  upgrade to the Validated type of user.
<br/>Through this procedure users can gain permissions to submit assessments or self-assessments and interact further with CAT Service features.
<br/>The user submits the Validation Request, assigned with a specific role (Actor) on behalf of a specific Organisation. </p>
<p>The procedure is completed successfully when an Admin user approves the validation request.</p>

<b>In the  <a href="https://cat.argo.grnet.gr"> DEMO instance</a> of the Compliance Assessment Toolkit , Validation Requests are approved automatically.</b>
